Debug the issue: $ARGUMENTS

Debugging approach:
1. Reproduce the issue if possible
2. Use Serena to understand relevant code context
3. Analyze error messages, logs, and stack traces
4. Identify root cause before implementing fixes
5. Consider edge cases and related functionality
6. Add tests to prevent regression

If the issue is complex, consider breaking it down with the orchestrator first.
